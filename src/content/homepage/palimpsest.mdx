In 1989, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama declared that humanity had reached the “End of History”. The Cold War was over. Western liberal democracy had prevailed. He lamented the loss of ideological struggle, and the looming monotony of this post-historic era. But there is another kind of End to History.

_Palimpsest_ (2023-ongoing) is a photographic project that explores this posthistoric landscape. If we all vanished tomorrow, what would remain?
