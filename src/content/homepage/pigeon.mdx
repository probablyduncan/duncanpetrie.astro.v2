Returning to photography after a year-long hiatus, I struggled to match the quality of my old work. My new images were weak. They lacked dynamism, punctum, decisive moments. No birds filled their skies.

_To Pigeon-Fill the Sky_ (2024) is a photographic storybook about birds, the creative process, and AI art.
