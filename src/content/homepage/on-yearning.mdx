The wide blue sea spread before me, a quilt of the patterns of the wind. I was suddenly struck by profound desire. A desire for what, I was not sure.

I was on the edge of the world, and I wanted to see beyond. It was a sort of nostalgia, but not for any real past. A nostalgia for the future, maybe, the future that can no longer be.

I wrote my undergraduate dissertation about this feeling. If you're interested in the theories behind my photographic practice, check it out.
