I grew up in boring old Wisconsin, and I spent the first 18 years of my life waiting to get out.

My dreams were too big for cows and cornfields. I was ready&mdash;had been for years&mdash;to escape, to see the ends of the earth through the end of a lens. I wanted mountains, icebergs, jungles. Pulled towards extremes, I never saw this lumpy wheat-swamp as a destination.

I think I do now.
