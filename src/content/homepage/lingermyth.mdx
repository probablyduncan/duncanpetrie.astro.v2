Gradually, we grew out of our past, explained away halos and beasts and cities of clouds. But it's still there, that old world. Like a first coat of paint, glinting out through chips and scratches.

_Lingermyth_ (2022) is an artist book of 50 images created as a final degree project for Marine & Natural History Photography at Falmouth University.
