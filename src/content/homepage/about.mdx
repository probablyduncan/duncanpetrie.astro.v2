(thatâ€™s me!) is a London-based photographer and writer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I explore nature in the human landscape, and what the world might look like when we are gone.

I graduated from [Falmouth University](mnhp) in 2022 with a degree in Marine and Natural History Photography.

See my [recent photography](palimpsest) or a [recent story](wind).
