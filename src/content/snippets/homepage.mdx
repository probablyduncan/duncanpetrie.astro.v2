## What have I done‚Åà

üìå&nbsp;&nbsp;My ongoing [photography](photography 'Photography Gallery') explores nature in the human landscape, and what the world might look like when we are gone.

üìå&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer of 2024, I made [To Pigeon-Fill the Sky](pigeon), an artist book about AI, the creative process, and, of course, pigeons.

üìå&nbsp;&nbsp;My most recent short story is [A List of the Wind](wind), about the sun, the wind, and beginning again.

### 2025

In February, I finished my [Sancho Simulator](sancho), a proverb generator inspired by Don Quixote.

In January, I learned how to [screenprint](https://bsky.app/profile/duncanpetrie.com/post/3lgsrvkcwi224/) my photography. I hope to be doing more of that soon.

<Space />

### 2024

In November, 2024, I was included in the [Dodho Color Awards](https://www.dodho.com/winners-color-awards-2024/), in great company.

In September, I wrote [A List of the Wind](wind), which is a short story about taking things one step at a time.

In August, I finished my photobook [To Pigeon-Fill the Sky](pigeon).

<Space />

### 2023

In July, I wrote _[The Man Upstairs](man-upstairs)_, which is a funny little poem about having neighbours.

I moved to London in early 2023. It took me forever to figure out how to take [pictures of London](photography?tag=london 'Gallery: London'), but then I realized I just needed a wider lens.

<Space />

### 2022

In July, I graduated from Falmouth University with a 1st class degree in [Marine & Natural History Photography](mnhp).

Between October, 2021 and April, 2022, I shot _[Lingermth](lingermyth '|2022-03-18-lingermyth-greenbank,2021-11-02-vacant-post-penzance,2021-11-02-jubilee-pool-penzance')_, a photobook about longing.

In February, I wrote _[A Necklace of Stars](stars '|2020-12-24-snowfall-pine-wood-i')_, a short story about destroying what you love.

<Space />

### 2021

In October, I finished _[On Yearning](yearning.pdf '|2021-06-20-yearning-door')_, my undergraduate dissertation. It's about the feeling you get when you look out across the sea at dusk, longing to remain with the day.

In March, I made a [short film](wiki '|/media/wiki.gif') using only photos and videos taken from Wikipedia. It's about the human experience, or something.

I was really into [seascapes](horizons 'Gallery: Seascapes') in 2021. I took a lot of blurry pictures of the horizon.

I also found a [really fluffy cloud](fluffy-cloud 'Cloud Discovered, Fluffiest in World').

<Space />

### 2020

I'm sure I did _something_ in 2020, but it's all kind of a blur.

I think I just took a lot of pictures of [birds](birds 'Gallery: Birds|2020-05-06-gosling-call-milwaukee-river,2020-05-12-lincoln-sparrow-milwaukee,2020-04-30-meadowlark-powerlines-wisconsin,2020-04-30-last-call-wisconsin').

Oh, I also made a [short film about pizza](pizza). This was during the first quarantine.

<Space />

### 2019

I graduated from high school, flew 4,000 miles, and started university in Falmouth, Cornwall.

I wrote a [weird little photo story](a-la-cart 'A La Cart') about the abandoned shopping carts I found around campus.

I also made my first website! It was [very bad](https://v1.duncanpetrie.com 'v1.duncanpetrie.com').

## Colophon

I built this website in 2025, but it's only the latest iteration in a long line of duncanpetrie.coms.

I made the first version ([yikes](https://v1.duncanpetrie.com 'v1.duncanpetrie.com')) because I needed a photography portfolio, and I didn't want to pay for Squarespace. Now, 6 years later, I've just about figured out how to center a div.

<Space />

### Design

Everything starts in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). I use Figma for planning my web projects, for mocking up random ideas, and even for photobook sequencing. It makes iterating very easy; it's like a digital countertop.

Even then, though, the design work is only half-done when I leave Figma. Most of my good ideas (especially around motion/animation) come from prototyping and playing around with vanilla javascript.

I try not to use too many external packages, especially at first. In my experience, pulling in quickstart stuff too early, like an animation library or a bunch of external component styles, prevents me from experimenting and being creative.

Headings on this website are set in [Junicode](https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font), which is apparently the ‚Äúfont for medievalists‚Äù as well as the font for Duncan. Body copy is set in [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/). 

<Space />

### Code

This version is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), which I love. Before that, I used [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs); Astro is such a breath of fresh air.

Animations are all my own. I like to see what I can do with [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame) and basic transforms.

I use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to write content, although I don't really take advantage of it.

<Space />

### Deployment

This website is hosted on [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks/astro/). If I didn't have a [guestbook](), I'd still be using [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

I use [Turso](https://turso.tech/) for a simple db.

I transferred my domains from GoDaddy to [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) in early 2025, and am very glad I did so.
