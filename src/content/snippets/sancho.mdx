# About

This is a Sancho Panza generator.

I read Edith Grossman's wonderful [translation](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/25/classics.miguelcervantes) of Don Quixote in early 2025, and one of the things I loved about it were Sancho's voluminous proverbs.

This page shows four to six proverbs, randomly selected from a large list. Most of them are taken verbatim, either from the Edith Grossman edition liked above or from the John Ormsby translation (available [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/996/pg996-images.html)). I also used [Sancho Panza's Proverbs](https://archive.org/details/sanchopanzasprov00cerv/page/n25/mode/2up) (Ulick Ralph Burke, 1892) as a reference.

Some of them are my own, or are switched up in a Mad Libs-esque musical chairs of medieval words. For example, "if the shoe fits" could also resolve to "if the nabcheat fits" or "if the gabardine fits". Yeah, we have fun around here.

This is a silly little page. You might have noticed some grammatical issues, or a few spelling mistakes. The code is pretty sloppy; I wrote most of it late at night after finishing Don Quixote. Nontheless, it seems to work ok, so I'm putting it here.

And that's the end of that.
