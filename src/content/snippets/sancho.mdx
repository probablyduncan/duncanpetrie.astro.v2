# About

This is a Sancho Panza generator.

I read the Edith Grossman translation of [Don Quixote](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/25/classics.miguelcervantes) in early 2025, and one of the things I loved about it were Sancho's voluminous proverbs.

This page renders four to six proverbs from a large list. Most of them are taken verbatim, either from the Edith Grossman edition liked above or from the John Ormsby translation (available [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/996/pg996-images.html)). I also used this [book of Sancho's proverbs](https://archive.org/details/sanchopanzasprov00cerv/page/n25/mode/2up) (Ulick Ralph Burke, 1892) as a reference.

This is a silly little thing. You might have noticed some grammatical issues, or a few spelling mistakes. The code is pretty sloppy; I wrote most of it late at night after finishing Don Quixote. Nontheless, it seems to work ok, so I'm putting it here.

And that's the end of that.
