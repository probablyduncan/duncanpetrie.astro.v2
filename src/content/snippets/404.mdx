What's the big idea, fella?

I'm still workin' on this page!

It's not ready yet!

Get outta here!

Go [back to the home page](/)!

<Space lines={12} />






What's so hard to understand?

_Four Oh Four!_

_Page Not Found!_

Doesn't look like there's much here, huh, smarty-pants?

Does this look like a place you want to be?

[Go home](/)!

What are you still doing here?!

Go on, git!

Scram!

Agitate the gravel!

Blow this pop stand!

[Go home](/)!

I _am_ working on this, you know!

Making pretty good progress, if I do say so myself.

Writin' code by the boatload!

It's a regular monkey-chain-typewriter situation over here!

Check back in a little while.

Maybe this page will be done soon.

And in the meantime...

[Go home](/)!

What?! You're still here?!

This place is dangerous!

There's workplace hazards left and right!

Wrenches, forklifts, nails flying everywhere!

Splinters waiting to be had!

OSHA violations up the wazoo!

I'm beggin you!

Just click the [link](/)!

Go [back](/)!

[Please](/)!

Hey!

Don't touch that!

Yeah, you!

Put that down!

Ok, seriously. Joke time is over.

I mean it.

Notice the change in my voice?

My measured tone?

No more exclaimation marks here, buddy.

You've gone too far.

There are consequences to these things, you know.

Files to be made with your name on them.

Lists to be updated.

People to be notified.

Probably, they're wearing sunglasses.

You still have a chance.

Just [go home](/)!
