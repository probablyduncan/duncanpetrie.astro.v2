Consider the usefulness of the beeping of the microwave. There is none!

A microwave's beep is redundant. If you want to be alerted when the timer is up, fear not! Microwaves are loud! If the plate isn't rattling and the motor isn't groaning, chances are your food is ready. No beep necessary. There's already an auditory cue for when the microwave's done: the sweet sound of silence.

And if, so insecure in your grip on time, you want to know how much longer until your food is ready, you need only to glance at the big, glowing, seven-segment clock, that marvel of user experience. It displays, precise to the second, the time remaining. If it shows all zeros, guess what? It's done! Again: no beep necessary.

The base wickedness of the beep of the microwave, however, extends beyond uselessness. It is no mere redundancy. It's an affront to human autonomyâ€”at our own request, the machines are micromanaging *us*!

If I don't immediately get my food, I will soon. I'll get to it! Maybe I'm busy! And even if I hadn't realized my food was done? So what? I'm sure I will soon. Know what's a good reminder to open the microwave? Wanting my food!

And the second beep. Oh, the *second beep*. The second round of beeps is the gut punch, the salt-in-wound, the final nail in the coffin of self-governance. It's the most insulting, incessant, condescending noise in the kitchen. It derails all trains of thought, shatters all notions of sovereignty, and drags the rug of sanity out from under our fragile souls. Its modus operandi is to hassle and harry. It shouts, cries, yaps and whines, an indignant "pick me!" over everything else.

The attention economy is saturated enough as it is. If I'm putting rice in the microwave for a minute and forget about it, shoot me! Have I lost my object permanence? Am I a baby? No!

*Waah, waah, look at me, I'm a microwave.* Shut up! I am a human being, a miracle of life! I turned you on myself, not thirty seconds ago! I am aware of you already! Can I not remember my food?

Machines are tools for achieving desire, but they are also tools for constructing desire. *Here's something we think you'll like.* Our pockets buzz with a billion useless shouts, cries, screams from nowhere. Irrelevant headlines, labeled breaking news, sent to break off another piece of us. Here's a two hour podcast you need to listen to, and a ten-episode docuseries you really should watch. So much content, ripe for consumption. Read this email! Watch this ad! Open the microwave! Now! Now! Or I shall beep at thee a second time!

There are surely grovelers, big-microwave bootlickers, who may side with the beep. To you, I say, go to hell. If not here, where does it stop? When dawn breaks, will your curtains shout "open me! open me!"? When it is cold, should your thermostat shout "turn me on! turn me on!"? What apocalypse is this?

I am reminded of the [words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_go_gentle_into_that_good_night) of a great poet, who said:

> Not cursed by cold [reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology)), nor stupefied to life depraved,\
> O chef, remain of quiet mind through timer's end.\
> Do not go gentle into that fools' parade.\
> Rage, rage against the beeping of the microwave.
