I come from a land where bugs can scream\
Where bugs have hopes and bugs have dreams\
Where you can hear them when you crush them\
When you crush them with your feet

I come from a land where sticks and stones\
Where sticks and stones will break bug bones\
And you do not need an ear trumpet\
To hear their wails and moans and groans\
(It’s like they all have megaphones)

I come from a land where bugs can scream\
Where bugs can whisper and can scheme\
Where bugs can vocalize their problems\
And you never need to lip read

I come from a land where bugs can whine\
Invertebrates they have no spine\
They walk around a little shaky\
And when they stroll they take their time

I come from a land where every fly\
Knows how to laugh and how to cry\
And they all know the bug condition:\
To live and live and live and die

I come from a land where bugs are free\
To express their identity\
When they say something homophobic\
They make a quick apology\
(They say that they are so sorry)

I come from a land where bugs can flirt\
Where bugs can love and bugs can hurt\
They have an existential crisis\
And the next day they’re back at work\
(9am Monday back at work)

I’ve seen the bug society\
The bugs have ideology\
They celebrate the revolution\
It’s a national holiday

I come from a land where bugs are free\
They work in the economy\
They generate shareholder value\
And they all have anxiety\
(They all go to therapy)

I come from a land where bugs can read\
They all know about history\
At buggy funeral proceedings\
Somebody reads a eulogy\
(We will all miss this bug dearly)

Bug funerals are never terse\
And that's for better or for worse\
They put a moth into a coffin\
And move it with a horse fly hearse

I come from a land where bugs can scream\
Where bugs can hope and bugs can dream\
You never have to guess what bugs are feeling\
Things are always exactly as they seem
